**We <3 Ruby** üòä <img src="/images/ruby.svg" width="20" style="vertical-align: -0.15em;margin-left: 0.1em" />

Ruby has always played an outsized role in clarifying the need for a higher-level of abstraction in software development. The _mountain of complexity_ required just to launch a straightforward web app (or even blog!) never seems to go away in our industry.

Against all odds, Ruby has held the line to keep those spaghetti-code frameworks at bay, and **the Ruby 3 era has done a fabulous job** making the language feel fresh and invigorating.

The modern tools & techniques available to Rubyists today aren't just for the backend. _They're for the frontend too._ That's why we started [Fullstack Ruby](/). **It's time to fall in love with Ruby all over again.**

## About Jared 

Howdy! I'm [Jared White](https://jaredwhite.com). I'm currently loving life in the Pacific Northwest üå≤ and building the next version of [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com), a "vanilla-first" progressive site generator & fullstack framework‚Äîpowered by Ruby, Roda, & esbuild.

I care about expanding the influence of the "alt Ruby" community (aka the world of frameworks outside of a certain train-themed behemoth üòâ) AND promoting the values of vanilla-first, HTML-first web development. Besides my work here at Fullstack Ruby, I've written a course called [CSS Nouveau](https://www.spicyweb.dev/css-nouveau) and run a [lively Discord server](https://www.spicyweb.dev) all about getting back to frontend basics.

    border-radius: 3px;
    margin-inline-start: clamp(var(--size-4), 5vw, var(--size-6));
    margin-block-end: var(--size-4);
    box-shadow: 4px 10px 30px -15px rgba(75,15,0,0.85);"
/>And with the upcoming release of Bridgetown 2.0, I'll be building out an ecosystem to power subscription-based indie publications so that my own platform [Intuitive+](https://plus.intuitivefuture.com) can be replicated by other Bridgetown developers who wish to offer educational products.

**Real talk:** I see a lot of conceptual overlap between the goals of many in the alternative Ruby community and the Use the Platform‚Ñ¢ web community. There's a desire to make it dramatically easier to onboard new developers, "go with the grain" of the underlying languages & APIs, and take rapid action to jettison gnarly "user-land" solutions whenever there are new features in the core platform. At the same time, I see some troubling tendencies in the Ruby web dev space to ignore modern browser advances and go with solutions either recommended by a particular framework (like Stimulus) or by framework authors (like Tailwind) which simply aren't the right tool for the job in the majority of cases.

In both those contexts, **I hope Fullstack Ruby has something meaningful to say.** You may not always agree with my viewpoints, but if I at least get you thinking, _then my job here is done_. üòä

## Technical Bits

This site is built using [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com), a Ruby-powered site generator I help maintain, and is hosted on [Render](https://render.com).

The theme is hand-crafted by me using vanilla CSS, and it uses [Declarative Shadow DOM](https://konnorrogers.com/posts/2023/what-is-declarative-shadow-dom/) to separate presentational layout markup from the content markup as well as deploy CSS Grid.

The logo is based off a font called [Marvin Visions](https://www.readvisions.com/marvin). The heading font is [Fugaz One](https://www.whatfontis.com/Fugaz-One.font) by Latinotype, and the body font is [Overpass](http://overpassfont.org) by Delve Fonts.

The icon set is provided by [Remix Icon](https://remixicon.com).
