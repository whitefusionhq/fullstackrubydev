There are [no full stack engineers](https://twitter.com/antero_nu/status/1473024746891661314?s=21)?! Let's talk about that. Also, just what is a componentized view architecture anyway? What are components? For that matter, what are templates? What are partials? I break it all down and explain why I'm gung-ho about view components. Plus I answer questions regarding Stimulus, nice_partials, and other Rails tooling from listeners like YOU! Enjoy, and keep on Ruby-ing!
