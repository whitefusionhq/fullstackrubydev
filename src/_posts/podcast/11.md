It’s tempting to want to take the simplistic approach of writing “to the framework” or to the external API directly in the places where you need to interface with those resources, but it’s sometimes a much better approach to create your own abstraction layer. Having this layer which sits between your high-level business logic or request/response handling, and the low-level APIs you need to call, means you’ll be able to define an API which is clean and makes sense for _your_ application…and then you can get messy down in the guts of the layer or even swap out one external API for another one. I explore all this and more in another _rousing_ episode of **Fullstack Ruby**.
