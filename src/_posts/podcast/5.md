Ruby is _optimized for programmer happiness_. What does that even mean? Which programmer? Whose happiness? What if you use Ruby and aren't happy? Does that mean Ruby failed?

All this and much more to be covered in today's episodeâ€”not a deep dive into a technical topic, but a deep dive into the philosophy of programming, the "Ruby way", OOP, the dangers of monocultures, and the need to recognize implicit biases when engaging in technology debates.
