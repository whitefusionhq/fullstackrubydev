Hey everybody, I’m so glad you could tune in for the debut episode of Fullstack Ruby. I’ve been on a few Ruby-themed podcasts over the past 18 months, but this is the first time I’m running a show about Ruby myself!

To kick things off, I'd like to introduce you to Ruby2JS and explain why I think this technology is a game changer.

Ruby2JS isn’t simply about an attempt to write what appears to be Ruby code for your website frontend. It’s really about writing JavaScript—AS IF JavaScript had Ruby's syntax and was inspired by Ruby’s stdlib, ActiveSupport, and the like. A "RubyScript" if you will.

Three examples I cover on today's episode:

- `set_timeout`

- `tap` & `yield_self`

- implicit `self` method calls within a class definition

[Visit the Ruby2JS website](https://www.ruby2js.com/) for live compilation demos, documentation on the various transformations and approaches available, and a whole lot more.

[Become a part of the Fullstack Ruby community](https://www.fullstackruby.dev/) and learn how to put your Ruby skills to work on the backend AND the frontend. Know somebody who's a JavaScript developer but is interested in learning more about Ruby? Share the site, podcast, or newsletter with them!

The Fullstack Ruby Podcast is a production of [Whitefusion](https://www.whitefusion.studio/), a boutique web studio based in Portland, OR.
