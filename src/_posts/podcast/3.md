Typically when you mention "Ruby" and "template" in the same breath, people will think of ERB. Perhaps even Haml. But did you know that the Ruby ecosystem offers a wide variety of template engines, and quite a few are built upon pure Ruby? In this episode, I break down the main conceptual difference between "string-based templates" such as ERB and "DSLs" such as Papercraft, the various options within each category, and some of the reasons you might want to choose one approach or another depending on your use case. Enjoy!
