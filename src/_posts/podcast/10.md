The rumors are true: **I became a Ruby developer because of Rails**. It's probably common that folks find a tech stack or framework which offers the features and the community they desire and so learn the language undergirding that stack. Truth is, Ruby did not appeal to me at first and I resisted it! I wanted to remain a PHP developer, damnit! But the industry draw of Rails required me to learn Ruby, and **I eventually fell head-over-heels in love with this language**. Now I find myself at a crossroads.

Gather around, my fellow devs, and listen to my story...
