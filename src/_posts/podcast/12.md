This is a right humdinger of an episode of **Fullstack Ruby**! I got the chance to talk with Karl Oscar Weber all about the Camping web framework, as well as his Grilled Cheese livestream, working as a freelancer, and how to criticize by creating as a programmer in a world fraught with political upheaval. *Great craic*, as the Irish say.
