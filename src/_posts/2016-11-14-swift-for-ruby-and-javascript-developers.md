Last week I had the privilege of presenting on the topic of learning Swift from the perspective of a developer currently familiar with Ruby or Javascript. I showed off some of the reasons why Swift is a pretty exciting language for those used to working with lightweight scripting languages, and I also demonstrated some example code that highlights similar functionality implementations across all three languages.

You can see the [presentation slides here][1], and [code examples are available on Github][2]. If you yourself are a developer in one or more of these languages and have suggestions for further code examples or useful comparisons, please submit a pull request on Github and let me know!
